          "While Oracler's mission is to bridge the gap between off-chain data and on-chain execution, our top priority during the collaboration was to ensure a reliable and secure launch of their decentralized oracle solution. We needed to deliver low-latency data feeds with high integrityâ€”without compromising speed or scalability.",
          "We kicked off the partnership with deep-dive workshops to align on goals, understand Oracler's target ecosystem (DeFi, GameFi, and beyond), and define key technical requirements. Together, we mapped out the architecture that would enable seamless integration with smart contracts while guarding against common oracle vulnerabilities, such as data manipulation or delayed updates.",
          "Once the architecture was in place, we moved to development. The backend infrastructure was optimized for rapid data ingestion, validation, and on-chain publishing, while ensuring tamper-proof delivery. Our tech stack included Solidity for on-chain logic and a robust off-chain system powered by Node.js and TypeScript.",
